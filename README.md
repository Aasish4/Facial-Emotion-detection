# Facial Emotion detection
An face emotion recognition system comprises of two step process i.e. face detection (bounded face) in image followed by emotion detection on the detected bounded face. The following two techniques are used for respective mentioned tasks in face recognition system.
  * Face detection using MTCNN: It is a convolution neural network based face detection algorithm, which I have separately shown in another repository.
